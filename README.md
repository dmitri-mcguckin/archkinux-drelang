# archkinux-drelang

My custom build for archLinux-releng. Primarily indented to be a remote-livedisk tool, for remote archlinux installation.

* Preloaded with OpenSSH
* Root contains my personal public key(s)
* Enabled tg3 and boradcom kernel modules by default (Broadcom ethernet drivers)
* Preloaded with custom DHCP host info (livedisk can always be accessed with `root@archlive.home`)
